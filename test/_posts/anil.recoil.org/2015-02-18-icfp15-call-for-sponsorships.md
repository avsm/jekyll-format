The call for papers for this year's [International Conference on Functional Programming](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/)
is about to close in two weeks, and over a hundred cutting edge research papers will be submitted on the theory, application and experiences behind
functional programming and type theory.  In addition to the main conference, there are also over 10 big [affiliated
workshops](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/affiliated.html) that run throughout the week on topics ranging from specific
languages ([Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/workshop/2014/), [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HaskellImplementorsWorkshop), [OCaml](http://ocaml.org/meetings/ocaml/2014/)),
the broader [commercial community](http://cufp.org), and even [art and music](http://functional-art.org/).

The ICFP conference experience can be a remarkable one for students.  Some
great ideas have emerged from random corridor conversations between talks with
the likes of [Phil Wadler](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/), or from
rain-soaked discussions with [Simon
PJ](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/simonpj/) at
[Mikeller](http://mikkeller.dk/), or in my case, from being convinced to [write
a book](https://blogs.janestreet.com/the-making-of-real-world-ocaml/) while in
a smoky Tokyo bar.  This year, it will be held in the beautiful city of
Vancouver in the fall.

We're committed to growing the ICFP community, not just in numbers but also in
diversity.  The [Programming Language Mentoring Workshop](http://plmw15.iisc-seal.net/)
has been at capacity since it started and will run again.  For the first time ever,
I am really excited to announce that the [Ada Initiative](https://adainitiative.org/) will
also be running an [Ally Skills](https://adainitiative.org/what-we-do/workshops-and-training/)
workshop during the conference.

Sustaining these activities and responsible growth means that we need to reach
ever wider to support the activities of the (not-for-profit) ICFP conference.
So as this year's industrial relations chair, I wish to <b>invite any organization
that wishes to support ICFP to get in touch with us</b> (e-mail at `avsm2@cl.cam.ac.uk`) and sponsor us.  I've put an abridged
version of the e-mail solicitation below that describes the benefits.
Sponsorship can start as low as $500 and is often tax deductible in many
countries.

> Corporate support funds are primarily used to subsidize students -- the

> 
> Last year, unprecedented levels of support from you and folks like you at
> over 25 companies and institutions made it possible for students from all
> over the world to attend ICFP 2014 in Sweden. The Industrial Reception, open
> to all attendees, was by all accounts a roaring success. All 2014 sponsoring
> companies had the opportunity to interact with the gathered students,
> academics, and software professionals.
> 
> This year, let's build on that success and continue to grow our community, and
> bring even more students to ICFP 2015 in Vancouver!
> 
> Your generosity will make it possible for students from all over the world to
> attend ICFP, the premier conference in functional programming.  There, they
> will meet luminaries in the field, as well as people who've built a successful
> career and/or business on functional programming.  They will return home
> inspired to continue pursuing functional programming in the confidence that
> exciting future careers await them.  For the first time, we will also host an
> Ally Skills workshop by the Ada Foundation, as well as continue the
> successful student mentoring workshop from previous years.
> 
> This year, we're continuing similar system of levels of financial support as
> last year. Our goal is to enable smaller companies to contribute while allowing
> larger companies to be as generous as they wish (with additional benefits, in
> recognition of that generosity).
> 
> The support levels, and their associated benefits and pledge amounts and
> benefits are as follows (costs in US dollars).

> Bronze:     $500: Logo on website, poster at industrial reception,
>           listed in proceedings.

> Silver:    $2500: As above plus: logo in proceedings, logo on
>           publicity materials (e.g., posters, etc.)
> 
> Gold:      $5000: As above plus: named supporter of industrial

>           and opportunity to include branded merchandise in 
>           participants' swag bag.
> 
> Platinum: $10000: As above plus: named supporter of whole event,
>           logo on lanyards, badge ribbon, table/booth-like
>           space available (in coffee break areas), other

>           on commercial involvement).

If you are interested, please get in touch with [me](mailto:anil@recoil.org)
or any of the [organizing committee](http://icfpconference.org/icfp2015/index.html).
If you're interested in helping out ICFP in a non-financial capacity (for
example as a student volunteer), then there will also be plenty of opportunity
to sign up later in the year.

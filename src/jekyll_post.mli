(** Jekyll blog post handling library

    {{:https://jekyllrb.com} Jekyll} is a simple, blog-aware static site
    generator that takes a template directory of files and turns them into a
    website. This library exists to parse those blog posts and make them easy to
    manipulate from OCaml code.

    {e %%VERSION%% â€” {{:%%PKG_HOMEPAGE%%} homepage}} *)

type t = {
  fname : string option;
  title : string;
  date : Ptime.t;
  slug : string;
  body : Jekyll_format.body;
  fields : Jekyll_format.fields;
}
(** [t] is a single Jekyll-format post that has been parsed *)

val of_string : ?fname:string -> string -> (t, [> Rresult.R.msg ]) Result.result
(** [of_string ?fname body] *)

val of_string_exn : ?fname:string -> string -> t
(** [of_string_exn ?fname body] operates as {!of_string} except that it raises a
    {!Jekyll_format.Parse_failure} exception on error. *)

val compare : t -> t -> int
(** [compare a b] will compare by date and then lexigraphically on the title *)
